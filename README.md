# NFL_underdog_predictor
Repo for the final project for DSGA-1007, Programming for Data Science. We will try to predict underdog victories in the NFL using machine learning techniques. 

DISCLAIMER: We are not doing this for gambling purposes, but rather to try and uncover patterns and trends previously undetected. We acknowledge the possibility that our model may fail to reliably predict underdogs in a way that is better than the Vegas Lines, but regardless, this presents a great exercise about machine learning as well as industry coding practices. It will actually prove useful to have the Vegas line as a point of reference: if our model is making the same predictions as the vegas line, then that would be signify our code is mostly on the right track :)
