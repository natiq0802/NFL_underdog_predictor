# NFL_underdog_predictor
Repo for the final project for DSGA-1007, Programming for Data Science. We will try to predict underdog victories in the NFL using machine learning techniques. We use a variety of data sources, feature engineering and prediction models to accomplish this goal. We acknowledge the possibility that our model fails to reliably predict underdogs in a way that is better than the Vegas Lines, but regardless, this presents a great exercise about machine learning modeling as well as industry coding practices. It will actually prove useful to have the Vegas line as a point of reference: if our model is making the same predictions as the vegas line, then that would be signify our code is mostly on the right track :)

DISCLAIMER: We are not doing this for gambling purposes, but rather to try and uncover patterns and trends previously undetected. This project is motivated purely by curiosity and has zero monetary incentives.
